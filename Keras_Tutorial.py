### Keras tutorial
# 
# Goal:
# 1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. 
# 2. See how to use it and build a deep learning algorithm.
# 
### Why Keras? 
# 
# * Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. 
# * Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. 
# * Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. 
# * However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that are still implemented in TensorFlow instead of Keras. 
# * Overall, Keras will work fine for many common models.

# Note: Have imported a lot of functions from Keras. Can use them by calling them directly in your code.
# 
# Don't have to create the graph and then make a separate `sess.run()` call to evaluate those variables.

### 1) Emotion Tracking
# 
# To build and train this model, gather pictures of some volunteers. The dataset is labeled.
#

# Run the following code to normalize the dataset and learn about its shapes.
X_train_orig, Y_train_orig, X_test_orig, Y_test_orig, classes = load_dataset()

# Normalize image vectors
X_train = X_train_orig/255.
X_test = X_test_orig/255.

# Reshape
Y_train = Y_train_orig.T
Y_test = Y_test_orig.T

print ("number of training examples = " + str(X_train.shape[0]))
print ("number of test examples = " + str(X_test.shape[0]))
print ("X_train shape: " + str(X_train.shape))
print ("Y_train shape: " + str(Y_train.shape))
print ("X_test shape: " + str(X_test.shape))
print ("Y_test shape: " + str(Y_test.shape))


# Details of the "Face" dataset:
# - Images are of shape (64,64,3)
# - Training: 600 pictures
# - Test: 150 pictures

### 2) Building a model in Keras
# 
# Keras is very good for rapid prototyping. Will be able build a model that achieves outstanding results.

def HappyModel(input_shape):
    """
    Implementation of the HappyModel.
    
    Arguments:
    input_shape -- shape of the images of the dataset
        (height, width, channels) as a tuple.  
        Note that this does not include the 'batch' as a dimension.
        If you have a batch like 'X_train', 
        then you can provide the input_shape using
        X_train.shape[1:]
    

    Returns:
    model -- a Model() instance in Keras"""
    
 
    # Define the input placeholder as a tensor with shape input_shape. Think of this as the input image!
    X_input = Input(input_shape) # height, width and channels as a tuple

    # Zero-Padding: pads the border of X_input with zeroes
    X = ZeroPadding2D((3, 3))(X_input)  # constructor call which creates an object

    # CONV -> BN -> RELU Block applied to X
    X = Conv2D(32, (7, 7), strides = (1, 1), name = 'conv0')(X)
    X = BatchNormalization(axis = 3, name = 'bn0')(X)
    X = Activation('relu')(X)

    # MAXPOOL
    X = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='max_pool')(X)

    # FLATTEN X (means convert it to a vector) + FULLYCONNECTED
    X = Flatten()(X)
    X = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='fc')(X)

    # Create model. This creates the Keras model instance, will use this instance to train/test the model.
    model = Model(inputs = X_input, outputs = X, name='HappyModel')

    
    return model


# Have built a function to describe your model. To train and test this model, there are four steps in Keras:
  
### Step 1: create the model.    

# Create a model by calling the function above
happyModel = HappyModel(X_train.shape[1:4]


### Step 2: compile the model
 
# Optimizers to try and include `'adam'`, `'sgd'` or others.  Documentation for [optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/)  
# Documentation for [losses](https://keras.io/losses/)

# Compile the model by calling 'model.compile'
happyModel.compile(optimizer = "adam", loss = "binary_crossentropy", metrics = ["accuracy"])


### Step 3: train the model

# Traub the model on training data
happyModel.fit(x = X_train, y = Y_train, epochs = 10, batch_size = 50)


### Step 4: evaluate model   

# Test the model on test data; Use `'X_test'` and `'Y_test'` variables to evaluate the model's performance.
preds = happyModel.evaluate(x = X_test, y = Y_test)

print()
print ("Loss = " + str(preds[0]))
print ("Test Accuracy = " + str(preds[1]))


## Expected performance:   
# If `happyModel()` function worked, its accuracy should be better than random guessing (50% accuracy).
# 
### Tips for improving your model:
# 
# To achieve a very good accuracy (>= 80%):
#
# until height and width dimensions are quite low and the number of channels quite large (â‰ˆ32 for example).  
# Can then flatten the volume and use a fully-connected layer.
# - Use MAXPOOL after such blocks.  It will help lower the dimension in height and width.
# - Change optimizer. 'adam' works well. 
# - If having memory issues, lower your batch_size (e.g. 12 )
# - Run more epochs until the training accuracy no longer improves. 
# 

### 3) Conclusion
# - Keras is a tool recommended for rapid prototyping. allowing to quickly try out different model architectures.
# - Remember The four steps in Keras: 
#  
# 1. Create  
# 2. Compile  
# 3. Fit/Train  
# 4. Evaluate/Test  

### 4 - Test another image (Optional) 
                        
img_path = 'images/my_image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(64, 64))
imshow(img)

x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = preprocess_input(x)

print(happyModel.predict(x))


### 5) Other useful functions in Keras
# 
# Two other useful basic features of Keras: `model.summary()` and `plot_model()`           
# 
# Run the following codes.

# Print the details of layers in a table with the sizes of its inputs and outputs
happyModel.summary()


# Plot graph in a nice layout
plot_model(happyModel, to_file='HappyModel.png')
SVG(model_to_dot(happyModel).create(prog='dot', format='svg')) # Save it to possibily share it on social media platforms
# It will be saved in "File" then "Open..." in the upper bar of the notebook.
