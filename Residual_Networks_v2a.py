# # Residual Networks
# 
# Learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets).
# Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allows to train much deeper networks
# In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train.
# 
# Goal:
# - Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets. 
# - Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification. 

# 

# Repository will be done in Keras. 
# 
# Run to load the required packages.

### 1) The problem of very deep neural networks
# 
# Neural networks have become deeper, with state-of-the-art networks going from just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.
# Vanishing gradient: The speed of learning decreases very rapidly for the shallower layers as the network trains.
# 
# Solve this problem by building a Residual Network!

### 2) Building a Residual Network
# 
# In ResNets, a "shortcut" or a "skip connection" allows the model to skip layers:  
# 
# By stacking ResNet blocks on top of each other, can form a very deep network. 
# Having ResNet blocks with the shortcut also makes it very easy for one of the blocks to learn an identity function.
# This means it can stack on additional blocks with little risk of harming training set performance.  
#
# Two main types of blocks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are same or different.
# Will implement both of them: the "identity block" and the "convolutional block."
# 
# - Skip connection "skips over" 2 layers. 
# - The upper path is the "shortcut path." The lower path is the "main path."
# - Have also made explicit the CONV2D and ReLU steps in each layer. To speed up training, have also added a BatchNorm step.
#

# Implement a slightly more powerful version of this identity block, in which the skip connection "skips over" 3 hidden layers rather than 2 layers.

### 3) - Building ResNet model (50 layers)
# 
# Have the necessary blocks to build a very deep ResNet. "ID BLOCK" stands for "Identity block," and "ID BLOCK x3" should stack 3 identity blocks together.
# - The 2D Average Pooling uses a window of shape (2,2) and its name is "avg_pool".
# - The 'flatten' layer doesn't have any hyperparameters or name.
# - The Fully Connected (Dense) layer reduces its input to the number of classes using a softmax activation. Its name should be `'fc' + str(classes)`.
# 
# Use this function: 
# - Average pooling [see reference](https://keras.io/layers/pooling/#averagepooling2d)
# 
# Other functions used in the code below:
# - Conv2D: [See reference](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d)

# Summary:
# - Very deep "plain" networks don't work in practice because they are hard to train due to vanishing gradients.  
# - The skip-connections help to address the Vanishing Gradient problem. They also make it easy for a ResNet block to learn an identity function. 
# - There are two main types of blocks: The identity block and the convolutional block. 
# - Very deep Residual Networks are built by stacking these blocks together.
