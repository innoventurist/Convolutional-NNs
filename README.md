<h2><strong><em> About </em></strong></h2>

<p>Deep Learning, also referred to as Neural Networks, can be implemented into various types of applications such as real estate, online advertising, image, audio,
 machine translation and autonomous driving. Methods and architectures used in these industries include convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural
 networks (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), dropout, batch norm, etc. Overall, the goal is for AI to be as close to the capabilities of a human based off
 the workings of the brain. </p>

<p>This section specifically looks at building different types of CNNs.</p>

<h2><p><strong><em>Goal:</em></strong></p></h2>

<p>To apply CNNs to visual detection, recognition tasks, etc. and using these algorithms for image, video and other 2D/3D data. An example is using neural style
transfer to generate unique works of art from your preferences of what you'd want the image to look like.</p>
